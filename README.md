# NewWebsite
This website is made using django in which I have used API to get news.
first fork this in a folder.
then open the folder using any IDE where you have fork the files.
now in terminal give the path form current folder to a folder in which there is a manage.py file in folder.
now in terminal write python manage.py runserver.
you get the link in the terminal.
now click on that link and the project open in your browser.
